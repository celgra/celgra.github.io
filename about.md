I'm a Computer Science dropout who was been extremely fortunate to break into the industry. I am halfway in to my second year of full time employent in the software industry and planning to finish my senior year. My interests lie in Software Architecture, Clean Code, Design, UX, and doing awesome things with JavaScript.

### Technology

I currently work in the ASP.NET stack for work using frameworks as ASP.NET MVC and Web API. I use JavaScript in my day to day as much as I can and always pitch solutions which JavaScript can offer amazing solutions. In my spare time I hack away on Node.js, React, and Angular projects. 

Note: I am also looking to return to Python. Shortly after my first programming course(C++) I found Python, I scripted and built web applications using Flask (as well as enriching my views with JavaScript) before joining my first job as a JavaScript dev and picking up .NET to contribute to a Desktop to Web platform migration.
